1.download the file and use tar -zxvf to unzip the files
2.call make seq, ./seq, and I get the result that FUNC TIME is 0.5
3.call make clean
4.call make seq GPROF=1, gprof seq|less, and read the diagnosis result
5.I identified that the bottleneck should be func1
6.emacs func.c and read the code in the source file
7.I decided to change the two major for loops in func1 into multithreading
version
8.Because the counters i,j, and variables index_X, index_Y are declared before
these two loops, and they will be assigned to different values in different
threads, as a result, I decided to make them private
9.make clean, then make omp, call ./omp, the FUNC TIME reduced to 0.1.
10.make check, the program returned silently.
11.make clean, then make omp MTRACE=1, call make checkmem, returned "memory not
freed".
